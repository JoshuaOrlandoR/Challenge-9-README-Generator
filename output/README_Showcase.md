  ## Description
  When it comes to README files, most people starting out with coding projects (and many people who have been in the industry for a long time), falter when it comes to their README for their projects. A good README not only provides professionalism, but it also makes it easier for other people to utilize and contribute to your application. This README genreator helps solve that issue, by providing users with a template of what should be included in their READMEs, all the while letting them input information to fill in each section. 

  ## Requirements
     To use this application, users should have access to VS code, or some other workspace program. They should also be familiar with JavaScript, Node, and Inquirer. 

  ## Installation
  To install the application, clone or download this project repository to your local machine. Unzip the file in your desired location.

  ## Useage
  To use the application, open the folder in any virtual workspace program, like VS Code. Once opened, open a terminal and run (without the quotes) "npm i" or  "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" to install the dependecy. Once this is done, in the console, type (again, without quotes) "node index.js" . Once this is done, follow the prompts and your README will be generated!
